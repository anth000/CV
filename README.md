Create a professional and elegant 2.5D illustration designed for an interactive portfolio website.

The scene shows a smooth minimalist hill in the foreground, with a small, simple, semi-realistic human figure sitting peacefully at the top. The environment must be clean, modern and premium — inspired by Apple-style gradients and MIT Media Lab visual design.

In the sky above the character, generate a structured 3D-like mind-map made of thin glowing lines and geometric nodes. The central node contains the text “Anthony Moulin”, and the surrounding nodes represent: “Artificial Intelligence”, “Data Science”, “Optimization & Decision Support”, “Process Mining”, and “Unity/AR Development”. Each domain may have a few smaller nodes (Python, TensorFlow, GANs, PM4Py, Firebase, React, C#, etc.).

The sky should visually support a time-of-day transition (sunrise → daytime → sunset → night). At night, the mind-map should glow softly like constellations.

Make the image ideal for parallax and depth-map animation: clear layer separation between foreground (hill + character), midground (mind-map), and background (sky).

Style: minimalistic, soft lighting, subtle gradients, premium, scientific, and professional. No cartoon look. Perfect for a dynamic engineering CV website.
